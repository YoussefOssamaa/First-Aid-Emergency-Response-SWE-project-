# 🆘 First-Aid-Emergency-Response-SWE-project

An **architectural software design project** for a gamified educational platform that teaches **first aid and emergency response** through **AI-powered simulations**. Developed as part of a Software Engineering course, the project focuses exclusively on **requirements analysis**, **UML modeling**, **user stories**, and **interface design** — **no coding or implementation** is included.

---

## 📌 Project Scope

> 🎯 **Goal**: To design the architecture for an intelligent, engaging, and adaptive first aid training system.  
> 🔧 **Focus**: Software modeling, analysis, and system documentation only (NO programming or working code).

---

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Model an AI-enhanced system to simulate emergency scenarios like CPR, burns, or bleeding control.
- Define system behavior, requirements, and data flow.
- Use UML and design artifacts to communicate how the system should work.
- Support personalized learning, real-time feedback, and gamification elements.
